### About Me
I am a 3rd year student of the BRU Faculty of Engineering and Economics. My goals are to become a successful programmer, learn something new and become better in this field. I have no work experience, but I created several projects during my studies. My greatest strength is C#, ASP.NET , created a backend on it using the MVC structure or Web API, also used ASP.NET Core Identity. From the frontend, I made up websites using React JS and Redux libraries, and also tried to write in TypeScript, below I gave a link to the repository of this project.
Although I have used all these technologies, I feel insecure about them. There is a lack of a strong JS base.

    var z = 3 * sequence[bi] + 1;
    if (y < z) { sequence.push(y); ai++; }
    else if (y > z) { sequence.push(z); bi++; }
    else { sequence.push(y); ai++; bi++; eq++; }
  }
  return sequence.pop();
